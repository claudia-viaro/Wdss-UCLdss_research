### :yellow_circle: Bayesian methods in sport statistics
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/sport_stats.jpg">

Bayesian methods are becoming increasingly popular in sports analytics. Identified advantages of the Bayesian approach include the ability to model complex problems, obtain probabilistic estimates and predictions that account for uncertainty, combine information sources and update learning as new data become available. The volume and variety of data produced in sports activities over recent years and the availability of software packages for Bayesian computation have contributed significantly to this growth. <br clear="left"/>
