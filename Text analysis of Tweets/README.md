<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/trumpcloud.png">

Text analysis is the process of using computer systems to read and understand text. Text can be in any shape and form - emails, tweets, social media comments, marketing copy, customer support tickets, survey responses. <br />
There are many tasks that can be performed: gaining insights into emotions, moods or opinions using sentiment analysis. For example, a favorable review often contains words like good, fast, and great. However, negative reviews might contain words like unhappy, slow, and bad.
