### :red_circle: Hidden Markov models
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/maxresdefault.jpg">

A Markov chain is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of events (random variables) where the probability of each event depends only on the previous event's state. These random variables can take values from a variety of sets: words, tags, or symbols representing anything, like the weather. In many cases, however, the events we are interested in are hidden: we don’t observe them directly. Eg, we don’t normally observe part-of-speech tags in a text. Rather, we see words, and must infer the tags from the word sequence. A hidden Markov model (HMM) allows us to talk about both observed and hidden events. <br />

Applications that can be explored lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Financial Time Series.
