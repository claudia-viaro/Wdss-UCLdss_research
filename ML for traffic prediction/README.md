### :yellow_circle: ML for traffic prediction

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/traffic_pic.jpg">

Traffic prediction is the task of forecasting real-time traffic information based on floating car data and historical traffic data, such as traffic flow, average traffic speed and traffic incidents; its uses include managing vehicle movement, reducing congestion, and generating the optimal route. The existing ML approaches are the random forest algorithm that creates multiple decision trees and merges their data to obtain accurate predictions and the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm relies on the principle of feature similarity to predict future values.
