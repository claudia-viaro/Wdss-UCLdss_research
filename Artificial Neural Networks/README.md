### :green_circle: Artificial Neural Networks

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/10639_2019_10053_Fig1_HTML.png">

Artificial neural networks are forecasting methods that are based on simple mathematical models of the brain. They allow complex nonlinear relationships between the response variable and its predictors. <br />

Application areas can lie in predicting solar radiation. The accurate prediction of solar radiation is crucial in both the solar industry and climate research. For example, forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system.  <br clear="left"/>
