### 1) Hidden Markov models
A Markov chain is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of events (random variables) where the probability of each event depends only on the previous event's state. These random variables can take values from a variety of sets: words, tags, or symbols representing anything, like the weather. In many cases, however, the events we are interested in are hidden: we don’t observe them directly. Eg, we don’t normally observe part-of-speech tags in a text. Rather, we see words, and must infer the tags from the word sequence. A hidden Markov model (HMM) allows us to talk about both observed and hidden events. <br />

Applications that can be explored lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Financial Time Series.<br />

### 2) Spatial Statistics
The term spatial statistics refers to the application of statistical concepts and methods to data that have a spatial location attached to them, and in which this locational element is used as an important and necessary part of the analysis. <br />

Its applications lie in exploring geographical determinants relevant for evaluating health intervention programmes or disaster management policies (eg, spatial inequalities within neighbourhoods such as poor road conditions that have an impact on child mortality or higher education outcomes). Another area of application could lie in exploring spatio-temporal dependencies to model climate data. Models that can be used include spatial autoregressive models, GLM, and Bayesian Hierarchical models.

Text analysis is the process of using computer systems to read and understand text. Text can be in any shape and form - emails, tweets, social media comments, marketing copy, customer support tickets, survey responses. <br />
There are many tasks that can be performed: gaining insights into emotions, moods or opinions using sentiment analysis. For example, a favorable review often contains words like good, fast, and great. However, negative reviews might contain words like unhappy, slow, and bad.

### 4) ML with images
There exist numerous ML/DL algorithms that deal with images as input variables and perform different tasks, from reconstruction to detection, classification, etc. <br />

Application areas can lie in the use of medical or satellite images. <br />

### 5) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Generative modelling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated). <br />

Application areas can lie in cryptography (e.g. finding the relationship between plain text and an encrypted code) or game theory.<br />

Preliminary literature:
- [Asymmetric cryptographic functions based on generative adversarial neural networks for Internet of Things](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0167739X21001801?token=8C6900AD05D39D59018EF1A7D8FCA1B1852A97009571DF52F1B89CFB2985FFAB6FF8B886406210A9C7C56A6CBBA85D1F&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220524223821)

### 6) Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural networks are forecasting methods that are based on simple mathematical models of the brain. They allow complex nonlinear relationships between the response variable and its predictors. <br />

Application areas can lie in predicting solar radiation. The accurate prediction of solar radiation is crucial in both the solar industry and climate research. For example, forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system. <br />

### 7) Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximise the notion of cumulative reward. <br />

Areas of application can lie in algorithmic trading strategies. <br />

Preliminary literature:
- [Deep reinforcement learning based trading agents: Risk curiosity driven learning for financial rules-based policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420311970)

### 8) Computational biology/Autoencoders
Finding new ways to repurpose or combine existing drugs has proven to be a powerful tool to treat complex diseases. Making predictions from this type of data is challenging because AI models need to learn how to generalise, or even extrapolate, interesting aspects of the structure of the data — without relying on labelled training data — to make predictions about new conditions. <br />

Preliminary literature:
- [Unlocking drug discovery through machine learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/unlocking-drug-discovery-through-machine-learning-part-1-8b2a64333e07)

### 9) Bayesian methods in sport statistics
Bayesian methods are becoming increasingly popular in sports analytics. Identified advantages of the Bayesian approach include the ability to model complex problems, obtain probabilistic estimates and predictions that account for uncertainty, combine information sources and update learning as new data become available. The volume and variety of data produced in sports activities over recent years and the availability of software packages for Bayesian computation have contributed significantly to this growth. <br />

Preliminary literature:
- [A machine learning framework for sport result prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210832717301485)
- [The Relative Importance of Ability, Luck and Motivation in Team Sports: a Bayesian Model of Performance in Rugby](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00001)

### 10) Global Forecasting Models (GFM) with ML
The paradigm in time series forecasting throughout decades has been to treat every time series as an independent dataset. As a result, traditional forecasting techniques are local, consider each time series separately and forecast it in isolation. However, nowadays, many companies are collecting large quantities of time series from similar sources routinely. <br />

Application areas lie in the use of a set of series for forecasting, as opposed to just one series (Global Forecasting Models). The global model has the same set of parameters (eg, the weights if the global model is a neural network) for all series in contrast to a local model which has a different set of parameters for every individual series. <br />
