### :green_circle: Text analysis of Tweets
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/trumpcloud.png">

Text analysis is the process of using computer systems to read and understand text. Text can be in any shape and form - emails, tweets, social media comments, marketing copy, customer support tickets, survey responses. <br />
There are many tasks that can be performed: gaining insights into emotions, moods or opinions using sentiment analysis. For example, a favorable review often contains words like good, fast, and great. However, negative reviews might contain words like unhappy, slow, and bad.

### :green_circle: Artificial Neural Networks

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/10639_2019_10053_Fig1_HTML.png">

Artificial neural networks are forecasting methods that are based on simple mathematical models of the brain. They allow complex nonlinear relationships between the response variable and its predictors. <br />

Application areas can lie in predicting solar radiation. The accurate prediction of solar radiation is crucial in both the solar industry and climate research. For example, forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system.  <br clear="left"/>

### :green_circle: Spatial Statistics
<img align="left" width="170" height="300" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/FBL5ktjXIAUg1Zf.jfif">

The term spatial statistics refers to the application of statistical concepts and methods to data that have a spatial location attached to them, and in which this locational element is used as an important and necessary part of the analysis. <br />

Its applications lie in exploring geographical determinants relevant for evaluating health intervention programmes or disaster management policies (eg, spatial inequalities within neighbourhoods such as poor road conditions that have an impact on child mortality or higher education outcomes). Another area of application could lie in exploring spatio-temporal dependencies to model climate data. Models that can be used include spatial autoregressive models, GLM, and Bayesian Hierarchical models.

### :yellow_circle: Bayesian methods in sport statistics
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/sport_stats.jpg">

Bayesian methods are becoming increasingly popular in sports analytics. Identified advantages of the Bayesian approach include the ability to model complex problems, obtain probabilistic estimates and predictions that account for uncertainty, combine information sources and update learning as new data become available. The volume and variety of data produced in sports activities over recent years and the availability of software packages for Bayesian computation have contributed significantly to this growth. <br clear="left"/>

### :yellow_circle: Reinforcement Learning

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/iStock-1145882183.jpg">

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximise the notion of cumulative reward. <br />

Areas of application can lie in algorithmic trading strategies.

### :yellow_circle: ML for traffic prediction

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/traffic_pic.jpg">

Traffic prediction is the task of forecasting real-time traffic information based on floating car data and historical traffic data, such as traffic flow, average traffic speed and traffic incidents; its uses include managing vehicle movement, reducing congestion, and generating the optimal route. The existing ML approaches are the random forest algorithm that creates multiple decision trees and merges their data to obtain accurate predictions and the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm relies on the principle of feature similarity to predict future values.

### :red_circle: Hidden Markov models
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/maxresdefault.jpg">

A Markov chain is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of events (random variables) where the probability of each event depends only on the previous event's state. These random variables can take values from a variety of sets: words, tags, or symbols representing anything, like the weather. In many cases, however, the events we are interested in are hidden: we don’t observe them directly. Eg, we don’t normally observe part-of-speech tags in a text. Rather, we see words, and must infer the tags from the word sequence. A hidden Markov model (HMM) allows us to talk about both observed and hidden events. <br />

Applications that can be explored lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Financial Time Series.

### :red_circle: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/20713844._SX540_.jpg">

Generative modelling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated).

Application areas can lie in game theory.
