<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/claudia-viaro/Wdss-UCLdss_research/blob/main/utils/ThinkstockPhotos-513688464.jpg">

There exist numerous ML/DL algorithms that deal with images as input variables and perform different tasks, from reconstruction to detection, classification, etc. <br />

Application areas can lie in the use of medical or satellite images. <br clear="left"/>
